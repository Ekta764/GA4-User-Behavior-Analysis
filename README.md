**Overview**
This project is a comprehensive Google Analytics 4 exploration of the Google Merch Shop demo account, analyzing 49,943 active users across 28 days from January 28 to February 24, 2026. The goal was to understand user behavior, identify conversion barriers, and provide actionable business recommendations using GA4's Explore feature.

**What I Did**
Free Form Exploration — Analyzed how users visit the site by device, city and browser. Discovered 57.8% desktop traffic concentrated in Silicon Valley, Chrome as the universal browser, and a major mobile tracking gap of 9,876 unidentified users.
Funnel Exploration — Mapped the full purchase journey from session start to purchase. Found 99.1% of users never view a product and only 17 out of 45,259 sessions result in a purchase.
Path Exploration — Traced user journeys step by step after landing. Found 82% of sessions lead to a page view but paths become highly fragmented afterwards.
Segment Overlap — Compared paid, mobile and direct traffic audiences using a Venn diagram. Found 64% of mobile users arrive directly and paid traffic reaches an entirely separate new audience.
Cohort Analysis — Measured weekly retention across user cohorts. Found 97.2% of users never return after their first visit with the best cohort retaining only 6.9% by Week 1.
User Lifetime Analysis — Compared lifetime value by acquisition channel. Found email users generate $33.11 LTV — 4x higher than any other channel despite being less than 1% of total traffic.
